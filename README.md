# viLDA
Varitional Inference Latent Dirichlet Allocation

## Project Description
viLDA is an R package that can estimate LDA models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and Variational Inference methods. In particular, we implement the Gibbs Sampler designed by Griffiths and Steyvers (2004) and the Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) algorithm developed by Hoffman et al (2013). The Gibbs sampler was mainly used as a baseline comparison and proof of concept, and the main focus of the package was to write optimized R and C++ code using the Rcpp interface to run SVI to estimate LDA models. We compare the performance of our package to the topicmodels package, which runs the Variational Expectation Maximization algorithm designed by Blei et al. (2003).

To install our package, you can visit the colab page at the URL http://bit.ly/viLDA and follow the steps to install the package using dev tools and run the main function.
