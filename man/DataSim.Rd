The user must specify values for N, p, and K, and either explicitly defines,
G()’s,F(),β’s, and ɑ or produces a generative process for them. First the
number of cells per group is decided by the function F() using parameters ɑ,
the last group has a fixed size to ensure the total number of cells is N.
Then for each cell the corresponding G(β) is used to produce the values of
the covariate assuming each cluster and gene has a different data generating
function G with different parameters β (Note: the user may choose to use the
same function; however, the model assumes they are different). The return
output would be a dataframe of N\*p size with a (k-1)\*1 vector detailing the
borders of the cell clusters by row.
